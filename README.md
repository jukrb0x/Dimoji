# 🍄 Dimoji
The born day of Dimoji (Dikemoji) `2021 0427`

# ❓ WTH is this
Dimoji is an alternative to Emoji, it's a dik-related epoch project. We hope our program will bring the world peace.

The first phrase is making every dik can be represented in Emoji! Then we will figure a way to emojify each dik-emoji

Here's some examples of Dimoji V1, created by one of the program founders [@Dr12zy](https://github.com/Dr12zy):

## Framework
We will need powerful weapons to make Dimoji possible, here we are with some primitive names.
- Diklang, a programming (or markup) language to create Dimoji and it's derivatives.
- Dimoji, the program itself.
- Ph.D, philosophy of dik.

# 💰 Donation
As this program just started, we need some sources of funds that make sure the program developing continuously, with more diks. Please consider donating to us to help Dimoji flourish. A cup of coffee brings harmony to the world with Dimoji. We thank you greatly for doing this honour action. We accept multiple ways to do so which will be introduced later.

# 🐞 Bugs exist
This document is made with pure emoji characters, you may not see them at the moment because your devices lacking sorts of character sets. We will be working on this kind of problem by replacing the emoji with emoji shortcodes or creating Diklang (Language for Dikemoji) to fix it.

If you are using an Apple device, you will not meet this problem, since Apple is our best friend and they are really enthusiastic to Dik-like programs.


🤞 Peace.
